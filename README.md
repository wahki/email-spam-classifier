## Features

- **Email Classification**: Classifies emails as spam or not spam.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Uses TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical format.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web application.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve spam detection.

## Installation

To set up the Email Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wahki/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Model**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/wahki/email-spam-classifier/releases) to download the latest model files. Follow the instructions provided to execute the model.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Input Format

You can input emails in plain text format. The application will process the text and display whether it is spam or not.

### Example Input

```plaintext
Subject: Congratulations! You've won a prize!
Body: Click here to claim your reward.
```

### Output

The application will display:
- Spam or Not Spam
- Confidence Score

## Model Details

The Email Spam Classifier uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which is particularly effective for text classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, ensuring it can accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

### Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: A dataset of emails is collected, labeled as spam or not spam.
2. **Preprocessing**: Emails are cleaned and preprocessed. This includes removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing.
3. **Vectorization**: TF-IDF vectorization converts the text into numerical format suitable for model training.
4. **Model Training**: The Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained using the processed data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Indicates how many of the predicted spam emails were actually spam.
- **Recall**: Shows how many actual spam emails were correctly identified.

## UI Overview

The user interface is built with Streamlit, allowing for quick deployment and an interactive experience. Key components of the UI include:

- **Input Box**: Where users can paste their email content.
- **Submit Button**: To process the email.
- **Results Display**: Shows the classification result and confidence score.
